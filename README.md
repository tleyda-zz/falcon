Falcon coding exercise

To build, run make in the top directory.
To clean, run make clean in the top directory.
To run tests, run testromancalc in the top directory.

The library creates an instance of the calculator.  The instance holds the result of the last add or subtract operation it performed.  The success of the operation can be determined by checking the length of the result.  The result can also be queried, of course.
